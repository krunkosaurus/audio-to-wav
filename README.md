# Audio to WAV Converter

This script was created to quickly convert audiobooks into `.wav` files, specifically for playback on the Teenage Engineering TP-7. It's designed to run really fast by using all available CPU cores on your machine, making it super efficient for handling large audio folders.

## Features
- Converts `.mp3` and `.m4v` audio files to `.wav` format.
- Supports recursive folder searching, so it can process files in nested folders.
- Optional concatenation: combines all `.wav` files in each folder into a single file (for easy audiobook playback).
- Deletes original `.wav` files after concatenation to save space.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- **FFmpeg**: The script relies on FFmpeg for audio processing. Install it through Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg

## Usage

1.	Clone or download this repo on your device.
2.	Place all your audiobook files (in .mp3 or .m4v format) in the empty `audio/` folder.
3.	Run the script by executing:

```bash
node script.js
```
Run the above if you want individual .wav files just like the original structure - for example if you have .mp3 files for every chapter of a book.

```bash
node script.js --concat
```

Run the above if you want to create a single merged .wav file for each book no matter how many audio files its split up in to.

In both cases the converted .wav files will appear in the `wav/` folder.

You can throw a ton of books / albums in the `audio/` folder to run them all at once. The folder structure will be kept.

You can leave your files/collections in the `audio/` folder and the script is smart enough not to run them again if they exist in the `wav/` folder.

**Note:** I wrote and tested this on a MacBook Pro, so I canâ€™t guarantee it works on other setups.

Important Settings

- Concat Mode: Set concatMode in the script to 1 if you want to concatenate files by folder. By default, this is enabled.
- Concurrency: The script automatically detects and uses all your CPU cores for maximum speed!
